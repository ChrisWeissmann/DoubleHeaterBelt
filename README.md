# DoubleHeaterBelt

I used a motorcycle kidney belt to create a double sided heating belt. Imitating a hot water bottle. This is the software for running it. Currently not finished.

Inprogress, migrating from arduiono mini and only one heating pad being used to a esp32 Lolin board with display and running both heating pads.
